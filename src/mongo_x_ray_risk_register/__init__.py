"""Risk Register — ChromaDB-backed vector search for known risks.

The public API is re-exported here; consumers should import from this package
rather than from the ``db``/``shared`` submodules, which are implementation
details. The enrichment functions operate on plain values (a ``list[dict]`` of
test results, a ``str`` category), so they never depend on any analysis
module's item types.
